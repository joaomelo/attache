# TL;DR

Attache is a SERP tracker. It crosses the presence of pages against results of search terms and reports that.

# Main Concepts

**Page:** A [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (or part of it) to be checked against search terms results. This is what we want to appear in the first search result.

**Term:** Keywords to be put against a single search.

**Stake:** Some product, service or any interest that aggregates sites and terms. 

**Subscriptions:** Series of stakes tied  to a contact information.

Contact = media and key (whatsapp + phone number)

# Typical Use case

Every day, I want to receive in my WhatsApp the positions of my pages A and B in Google searches against the search terms W, X and Y.
