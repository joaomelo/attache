# TL;DR

Attache is a SERP tracker. It crosses the presence of sites against results of search terms and reports that to stakeholders.

# Main Concepts

**Stake:** Some product, service or any interest that aggregates sites and terms. Is the main point of performance analysis.

**Page:** A [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (or part of it) to be checked against search terms results. This is what we want to appear in the first search result.

**Term:** Keywords to be put against a single search.
