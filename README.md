# TL;DR

Attache is a SERP tracker. It crosses the presence of pages against results of search terms and reports that.

# Main Concepts

**Page:** A [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (or part of it) to be checked against search terms results. This is what we want to appear in the first search result.

**Term:** One or more keywords to run in a single search.

**Ranking:** The position of a page against term search results in some point in time.

**Contact:** A channel setup to send reports to - e.g: WhatsApp +1 (555) 555-5555 or email me@email.com.

**Subscription:** An aggregation of pages and terms to be ranked daily and a contact to receive reports about it.

# Typical Use case

Every day, I want to receive in my WhatsApp the ranking of pages `company.com` and `landing-page.com` in Google searches against terms `service`, `service my-city` and `service my-neighborhood`.
