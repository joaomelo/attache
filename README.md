# TL;DR

Attache is a SERP tracker. It crosses the presence of pages against results of search terms and reports that.

# Main Concepts

**Page:** a [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (or part of it) to be checked against search terms results. This is what our want to appear in the first search result.

**Term:** one or more keywords to run in a single search.

**Ranking:** the position of a page against term search results at some point in time.

**Stake:** combination of pages and terms to be ranked periodically. Represents an product, service or any personal interest.

**Contact:** a channel setup to send reports to - e.g: WhatsApp +1 (555) 555-5555 or email me@email.com.

**Subscription:** a stake and some contacts to receive reports about its rankings.

# Typical Use case

Every day, I want to receive in my WhatsApp the ranking of pages `company.com` and `landing-page.com` in Google searches against terms `service`, `service my-city` and `service my-neighborhood`.
