# TL;DR

Attach√© is a minimal SERP tracker built with personal use in mind. It periodically reports the position of pages in organic search results.

The use case would be: every other day, I want to receive in my email the updated Ranking of pages "company.com" and "landing-page.com" in searches against the Terms "service", "service my-city" and "service my-neighborhood".

# Main concepts

**Stake:** combination of pages and terms that Attach√© will take Snapshots. The Stake will also contain a list of emails to send Track reports.

**Page:** part of an [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) to check against search results. The Page is what we want to appear as close to the first search result as possible.

**Term:** one or more keywords to search periodically. Something as `my service` or `my service my city`.

**Snapshot:** ordered list of pages as they appear in the result of an organic search. The Snapshot additionally holds metadata like when the search happened. The app takes daily Snapshots for every Term.

**Ranking:** time series of a Page position in Snapshots. 

**Trend:** time series of the first Page in Snapshots. 

**Track:** report with coverage about the last days' Trend and Ranking sent to the Stake's associate emails.

# How It Works

Attach√© is a combination of two serverless functions that run periodically. The first is the `snapshotsScheduledService` which saves Snapshots for every Stake's Terms in the database.

The second is the `tracksScheduledService`. It dispatches email reports with Rankings and Trends data for every Stake.

Both services run in [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) and use [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) as database. It likewise relies upon [Scale SERP](https://www.scaleserp.com/) to run organic searches and [Send Grid](https://sendgrid.com/) to dispatch emails.

Attach√© is developed using Javascript and takes advantage of the language thriving open source library ecosystem. All project dependencies are available in the [package.json](package.json) file.

# Getting Started

The first step is to clone the repo with git and install all dependencies.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/joaomelo/attache.git
npm i
```

Now you can get familiar with the project directories and files.

``` js
üìÇattache
  *.*         // project files
  üìÅ.github   // github actions for ci/cd pipeline
  üìÅdist      // bundled code for production
  üìÅsrc       
    üìÅapp     // services and i/o
    üìÅdomain  // business core
    üìÅhelpers // generic functions
    üìÅmain    // glues everything into serverless functions
  üìÅtests     // support test files
```

Before we start developing, we need to get rid of some environmental tasks.

## Environment Configuration

To enable Firebase [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) and [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), you need to create a [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) and set local development with their [local emulator suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite).

Now is also an excellent time to create accounts and note the search and email services' API keys. [Scale SERP](https://www.scaleserp.com/) and [Send Grid](https://sendgrid.com/) sites have the proper instructions.

Regarding Send Grid, It is essential to register the email you will use to dispatch Track Reports.

With all that information in hand, we can create a `.env` file at the project root directory and fill it with our services' corresponding data.

``` env
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080
SCALE_SERP_KEY=SOME_API_KEY_VALUE
SEND_GRID_KEY=SOME_API_KEY_VALUE
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=some@email.com
```

I must say I have no affiliation with any of these services. I chose them from personal familiarity, ease of use, or free tier convenience. But Attach√© was built aiming at easy substitutions. You can take advantage of that if some of the services do not suit your particular needs.

## Engine Start

The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. By executing `npm start`, you turn on tests in watch mode and can begin coding. It is easy to focus on a particular module applying file patterns through Jest CLI options.

But be aware these tests don't massage the final serverless functions. These functions are tiny and take care only of putting together dependencies. Nevertheless, If you want to run them locally, type the command `npm run shell`.

The [shell interface](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/local-shell) enables local interactive invoke of Firebase functions from the command line.

# Deploy

## Locally

You can deploy the serverless functions to Firebase from your local machine. To do that, execute `npm run deploy:local`.

This command will take advantage of the same `.env` file used for development and the Firebase project configuration.

## Continuous Delivery

There is also a workflow to deploy automatically from GitHub using GitHub Actions.

This pipeline additionally uploads test reports to [Codecov]( https://about.codecov.io) service. Codecov generates complete and interactive code coverage reports. You can create a free account and obtain an API key on their website.

Going back to GitHub Actions, you need to set some GitHub variables for things to work correctly. You do that by creating a GitHub secret for every workflow variable. The secrets required are listed below.

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT 
FIREBASE_TOKEN
SCALE_SERP_KEY
SEND_GRID_KEY
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
CODECOV_TOKEN
```

# Wrapping up

The project has very limited ambitions. Although some bugs will undoubtedly come, there are not many more things to do as long as I can see. If you need any help, I'm glad to listen. Just contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joaomeloplus).

üññ Live long and prosper.
